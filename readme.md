## CREATED BY MARS CANNON (Algrythm) :D

## Description

This application is designed for generating a unique language with your own parameters. It can be used for books, games, movies, etc. as a substitute for having to create your own language from scratch. 

The app generates a unique language based on your parameters using a dictionary of ~61000 common English words for reference. Language structure will remain the same as English, but it will be unintelligible to anyone, because it generally shares no similarities to any other existing languages. You CAN customize the language it generates to your liking, adding words that ARE similar to existing languages for nicer flow, if you would like.

The app comes with 2 pre-made languages, Inuevo, which is a randomly generated language with a few modifications inspired by Spanish, and Yatsk, a randomly generated language with a few modifications inspired by Russian. Feel free to use these languages in your projects if you'd like.

I think it would be pretty cool if people make custom languages and share them so that new con-langs could be constructed using this app, with eventual modifications being made as time goes on! So go ahead, share your languages! [ or build on my existing ones (; ]

## How to use

Run 'run.bat' to start the Python app. If you download another pre-made language, place it inside of the languages folder. Follow the instructions in-app to create your language.

*DO NOT RUN THE APP AS ADMIN. When batch files are ran as admin, they are executed within the System32 directory which this app is not intended to handle.

*DESIGNED FOR WINDOWS 11. I may add versatility for other windows versions later.
